        <h3>About Alen</h3>
          <p> After working in the tech industry for the past three years I have decided to change my career and have now gained a new passion for coding.</p>
          <p>When I am not working or furthering my skills in coding I like to enjoy the outdoors with my family. My fiance and I like taking our daughter out to the beach on as many sunny weekends as we can.</p>
          <p>I am always looking to work with other developers and learn new skills</p>
